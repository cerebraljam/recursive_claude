# Game Mechanics Evolution for Hunter Hunt

## Core Engagement Strategy

For a humorous Duck Hunt-inspired game where players shoot hunters, mechanics should emphasize **variety, progression, and comedic timing** rather than pure difficulty spikes.

## Hunter Types & Behaviors

- **Basic Hunter**: Slow-moving, obvious targets (tutorial level)
- **Camouflage Hunter**: Blends with background, requires keen observation
- **Speed Hunter**: Quick, erratic movement patterns
- **Decoy Hunter**: False targets that penalize hasty shooting
- **Boss Hunters**: Larger, multi-hit targets with unique animations

## Power-Up System

**Immediate Impact**: Spread shot, slow-motion mode, magnet bullets
**Progression Elements**: Weapon upgrades, score multipliers, combo meters

## Scoring & Difficulty Progression

**Balanced Approach**:
- Score based on accuracy (headshots > body shots)
- Combo bonuses for consecutive hits
- Time penalties for missed shots
- Progressive waves with increasing hunter density
- Seasonal/themed hunter variants to maintain freshness

## Engagement Retention

The key is **cooperative game design** - players vs. environment rather than punitive mechanics. Humor through animations, sound effects, and hunter reactions creates positive feedback loops that encourage repeated play.

**Target Audience**: Casual gamers seeking nostalgic, lighthearted entertainment with progressive challenge.
